# 🌏📗 GIS-Drone-and-Machine-Learning-for-Resource-Mapping-QGIS-Week-7(Trees) 🗾
#  🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 7, we moved into a more advanced and practical application of remote sensing and AI-powered mapping by utilizing Google Earth Pro, Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning to analyze the environmental impact of urbanization.

Our focused case study involved the Railway Colony area of Liluah, Howrah, West Bengal, where we investigated the effects of deforestation due to urban growth and evaluated the effectiveness of government-led afforestation programs over a period of 13 years (2011–2024).

The most powerful aspect of this analysis is that we did not physically visit the site — all data was collected and analyzed remotely using GIS tools, historical imagery, and AI-driven interpretation. This is a real-life example of how smart geospatial systems are reshaping environmental monitoring.

# 🎯 Objective
- To use Google Earth Pro and historical satellite imagery to track tree loss due to urban expansion.
- To monitorr the increase in air, water, and soil pollution from declining green cover.
- To monitor the impact of afforestation efforts taken under government initiatives, particularly in the Liluah Railway Colony.
- To demonstrate how Remote Sensing + AI/ML + GIS can be used for real-time environmental monitoring without field visits.
- To showcase how modern tools enable faster, more accurate, and cost-effective resource mapping.

# ✨ Key Features
- Use of Google Earth Pro to compare imagery from 2011 to 2024.
- Identification of deforestation zones and their consequences.
- Highlighting afforestation improvements in red-marked areas.
- No physical surveying — entire process done via remote sensing + AI analysis.
- Use of geo-tagging, polygon marking, and visual comparison.
- Output visualizations to show pollution control improvements and tree cover increase.

# 🛠️ Project Steps
- Opened Google Earth Pro and navigated to Liluah Railway Colony. 
- Used the historical timeline slider to compare satellite imagery from 2011 vs 2024.
- Marked areas showing tree loss using polygon overlays.
- Tracked the increase in vegetation cover in the same regions using visual and spectral changes.
- Noted positive impacts under government tree plantation schemes as part of National Green India Mission.
- Evaluated the findings using AI/ML-driven geospatial analysis models for enhanced accuracy and pattern detection.

# 📊 Benefits of AI + Remote Sensing in This Analysis
- ✅ Advantages Over Traditional Methods:
  - 1.⚡ 3x Faster than manual field-based survey methods.
  - 2.🧍‍♂️ Minimal Labor Involvement — low human effort and risk.
  - 3.🎯 High Accuracy with repeatable, automated detection.
  - 4.🚀 Highly Efficient in terms of time and scalability.
  - 5.💰 One-time Infrastructure Investment with very low operational costs.
  - 6.💾 Easy Data Storage, Management & Sharing through databases and GIS servers.

# 🧪 Analysis Summary
🌆 Problem:
  - Rapid urbanization led to continuous tree-cutting, affecting local air quality, groundwater, and soil health.
  - Manual monitoring methods were inefficient, expensive, and time-consuming.

🌿 Government Response:
  - Afforestation initiatives launched in the Liluah Railway Colony under the National Mission for a Green India.

📈 Observed Results (2011–2024):
- Noticeable increase in green cover in red-marked zones.
- Reduction in visible pollution impacts through increased vegetation.
- Effective use of AI, GIS, and Remote Sensing technologies to verify outcomes remotely.

# 📝 Requirements
- ⬇️ Install Google Earth Pro (Download Free): [Official Website](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/earth/about/versions/#download-pro) (Latest Verson).
- Stable Basic internet connection
- Optional: QGIS or any GIS-compatible software
- Historical LiDAR / satellite datasets
- AI-ML toolkits for spatial image classification (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, etc.)

# ✅ Conclusion
This week's analysis highlights how Remote Sensing, GIS, and AI/ML can effectively monitor urbanization and environmental recovery. Without on-ground surveys, we were able to track afforestation impact and validate government initiatives using technology—proving it to be faster, accurate, and highly efficient for sustainable planning.
